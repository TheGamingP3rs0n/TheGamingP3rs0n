- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheGamingP3rs0n, male coder that's interested in modding things, making things, and just things in general. Iâ€™m currently learning How to make a virtual desktop assitant like Siri, but smarter and for Windows! : ) Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Many projects with developers to make stuff for the community, or public. I make projects for functionality and to help. How to reach me? I dont really have any socials yet. I'm pretty unheard of!

Fun fact: I just started developing stuff on 1/12/25!
